# Home Lab Network and IT Infrastructure Project

This repository documents my journey in building and configuring a comprehensive home lab network and IT infrastructure. 
The project showcases my skills in networking, system administration, scripting, and cloud orchestration, ultimately creating a professional portfolio for job applications.

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to:
- Set up a fully functional home network using Cisco networking equipment, servers, endpoints and wireless AP.
- Configure switches, routers, firewalls, and endpoints from scratch.
- Implement advanced IT concepts such as containerization, virtualization, orchestration, and cloud computing.

## **Hardware Used**
- **Networking Equipment**:
  - 2 x Cisco Catalyst Switches
  - 1 x Cisco Router
  - 1 x Cisco ASA Firewall
- **Server**:
  - 2 x Dell Optiplex (Proxmox for virtualization)
- **Wireless Infrastructure**:
  - Google Nest as wireless AP
- **ISP Connection**:
  - ISP Modem for Internet Access

## **Skills Demonstrated**
This project includes implementation and documentation of the following skills:

### **Networking**
- Configuring Cisco switches, routers, and firewalls.
- VLANs, trunking, inter-VLAN routing, and access control lists (ACLs).
- Secure remote management (SSH, Telnet, RADIUS).

### **System Administration**
- **Linux**:
  - User management, server configuration, and RHEL virtualization.
  - Bash scripting for automation.
- **Windows**:
  - Active Directory, patch management, and Office 365 integration.
  - PowerShell scripting.

### **Virtualization**
- Setting up virtual machines with Proxmox, VMware, and Oracle VirtualBox.

### **Containerization and Orchestration**
- Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Ansible.
